# Styled Components Crash Course (with TypeScript)

This is the project I created when following along with the [following tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02zO0hZmwnw). This tutorial uses JS, but I decided to use TS since that is what our team uses. There are a few gotcha's here, so I hope this can be helpful. To use styled-components with TS, will need to download the [types package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/styled-components) on npm.
